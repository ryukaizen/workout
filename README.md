# **4-Week HSP Full-Body Training Program** üí™

This plan is designed to help you maximize strength, hypertrophy, and muscle endurance through a combination of **Heavy**, **Stretch**, and **Pump** days. Each session targets all major muscle groups with progressive overload principles to ensure consistent growth. I have not emphasized on lower body much, one can always tweak the exercises and and balance that out. Since the main focus is on looking big in cloths.

## **Training Structure** üóìÔ∏è

- **Heavy Day**: Strength-focused with controlled 1/1 tempo. Push heavy loads while leaving 1‚Äì2 reps in reserve.
- **Stretch Day**: Controlled eccentric movements (1/5 tempo) with static stretching to maximize muscle elongation and fiber recruitment.
- **Pump Day**: Fast-paced, high-rep work with a 0/0 tempo for maximum muscle burn and blood flow (hypertrophy focus).

## **Progressive Warm-Up and Working Sets** üìà
Each week, the ratio of warm-up to working sets will shift to progressively increase intensity:  
- **Week 1**: 4 warm-up, 1 working  
- **Week 2**: 3 warm-up, 2 working  
- **Week 3**: 2 warm-up, 3 working  
- **Week 4**: 1 warm-up, 4 working

## **Notes on Recovery and Gains** üõå
- **Recovery**: Rest days are essential. Prioritize sleep, hydration, and proper nutrition to maximize performance.  
- **Gains**: This program balances hypertrophy (stretch and pump days) with strength (heavy day), ensuring consistent progression over 4 weeks.
